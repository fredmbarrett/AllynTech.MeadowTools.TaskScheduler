# AllynTech.MeadowTools.TaskScheduler

The **AllynTech.MeadowTools.TaskScheduler** is an open-source task scheduling library developed by **Allyn Technology Group**.  
It provides a lightweight, high-performance scheduler optimized for constrained environments like the Wilderness Labs Meadow F7, but can be used in any .NET Standard 2.1 project.

## ‚ú® Features
- Min-heap‚Äìdriven event loop for efficient scheduling
- Supports per-second, per-minute, hourly, and daily recurrence
- Worker pool with bounded concurrency
- Low memory footprint (optimized for IoT devices)
- Thread-safe operations with minimal overhead
- Extensible factories for creating schedule types:
  - **Call-In schedules**
  - **Data Log schedules**
  - **GNSS lookup schedules**
  - **Sensor Poll schedules**

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Requirements
- .NET Standard 2.1 or higher
- Compatible with Meadow.Foundation and Meadow.Core (for Meadow devices)

### Installation
Clone the repository and add the project to your solution:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredmbarrett/AllynTech.MeadowTools.TaskScheduler.git
```

Then reference the project in your `.csproj`:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="path/to/TaskScheduler.csproj" />
```

### Example Usage

```csharp
var scheduler = new SchedulerService();
await scheduler.Start();

var entry = new ScheduleEntry(
    scheduleId: 1,
    scheduleName: "Example Job",
    kind: ScheduleKind.DataLog,
    maxRuntime: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    nextRunUtc: DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(5),
    work: async (ct) => { Console.WriteLine("Hello from scheduled task!"); },
    computeNext: (last, runtime) => last.AddSeconds(30)
);

scheduler.AddOrReplace(new[] { entry });
```
